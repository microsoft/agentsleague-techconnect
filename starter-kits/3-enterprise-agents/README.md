## 🛡️ Security & Best Practices

Security is paramount when building enterprise agents that handle sensitive organizational data and integrate with Microsoft 365 services. When writing custom code, follow these guidelines to ensure your solution meets enterprise security standards:

### Microsoft 365 Security Integration

- **Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)**: Your agent **must** leverage Microsoft Entra ID for user authentication and authorization. This ensures that users are properly authenticated before accessing agent capabilities and that authorization policies are enforced consistently across the enterprise.

- **User Authentication**: Implement proper authentication flows that require users to sign in with their organizational credentials. Use OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols to securely authenticate users and obtain access tokens for downstream API calls.

- **Authorization & Permissions**: Define granular permissions for your agent based on the principle of least privilege. Ensure that users can only access data and perform actions that are appropriate for their role and responsibilities within the organization.

- **Conditional Access Policies**: Design your agent to respect organizational Conditional Access policies, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) requirements, device compliance checks, and location-based access controls.

### Best Practices

- **Data Protection**: Handle sensitive data responsibly by implementing proper data encryption, avoiding unnecessary data storage, and following data residency requirements.

- **Audit & Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging to track agent interactions and support security audits. Ensure logs capture relevant metadata without exposing sensitive information.

- **Secure Development Lifecycle**: When writing code, follow secure coding practices throughout development, including input validation, output encoding, and protection against common vulnerabilities.

- **Token Management**: Store and handle access tokens securely. Never expose tokens in logs, URLs, or client-side code.
